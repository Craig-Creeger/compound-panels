Compound Panels
===============

Standard (client-side) App
--------------------------
This is a React component that can render:
  * A standard accordion panel (one panel is always visible)
  * A collapsible accordion panel (it is possible to close all panels)
  * A series of independent panels.

To see a demo,
  1. Clone this repo.
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm start`
  4. Browse http://localhost:8080


Server-Side App
---------------
There is also a version that does React rendering on the server. It can be found in branch
`serverSideRendering`. That version only uses standard accordion panels.
